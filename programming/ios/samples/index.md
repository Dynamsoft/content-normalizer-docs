Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Document Normalizer.

### License

A network connection is required to verify the trial license in the samples. If your license is expired, you can go to the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=ddn&utm_source=documents" target="_blank">customer portal</a> to request for a private trial license.

### Video Document Normalizing

Most of the Dynamsoft Document Normalizer mobile samples are designed for video document normalizing. Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is applied to the video document normalizing samples to support the acquisition of video input. At the same time, some of the DCE features benefit the document normalizer, which is illustrated in the samples. For more usage about DCE, please view more in <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/introduction/?ver=latest" target="_blank">DCE online documents</a>.
